# AeCAD Data

All component data should reside in its `Group.data`.


    data:
        tmp: *bool* Temporary item, will be remove on import
        aecad:
            tid: "Trace ID" (if this is a trace)
            layer: *String*: one of "F.Cu, B.Cu"
            type: *String* one of "via, drill, $footprint"
            name: *String* Instance name
            pin: *Int* Pin number of the $footprint, starts from 1; `0` means `N.C`
            group: *Array* of group names.
            label: Label of handle (eg. pin)

### when aecad.type is "via"


### Temporary Objects

```
data:
    tmp: true
```

#### Handles

...for segment handles:
```
data:
    tmp: true
    role: \handle
    tid: "the selected trace's id"
    curve: hit.location.curve
```
...for point type handles:
```
data:
    tmp: true
    role: \handle
    tid: "the selected trace's id"
    geo: \c, # means this is circle
    segment: hit.segment
```

# Global Behavior

* `Shift + |mousemove|`: Pan in pointing stick mode
* `Del`: Delete selected item
* `Ctrl + z`: Undo

# Selection

1. Clicking will select only child objects under a layer.
2. If object is a group, "open the object" must be clicked
3. Trace routes are exceptions, their segments or curves will be selected on
    click. `Ctrl + |click|` will disable this rule (thus select the group.)
4. Selecting all objects in the same `Layer` is possible by:
    1. `Ctrl + a` (TODO) (Currently selects everything in the project)
    2. Via tree view (TODO)
5. `Drag`: Creates a selection box
    1. Left to Right: select items inside the selection
    2. Right to left: select items touches the box

# Move

Move mode does what selection does + moves the selected item(s) by:

1. By drag and drop
2. Pick and place (shortcut: a/a)

Traces are handled specially: Left and right curves' slope is preserved

## Keys

2. `Esc`:
    1. In Move: Cancel movement (restore the item position)
    2. On Idle: Activate Selection Tool.
3. `Ä±`: Rotate CW
